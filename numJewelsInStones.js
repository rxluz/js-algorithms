/*You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3*/

/**
 * @param {string} J
 * @param {string} S
 * @return {number}
 */
var numJewelsInStones = function(J, S) {
  const reg = new RegExp(`[${J}]`, "g");
  return (S.match(reg) || {}).length || 0;
};

console.log(numJewelsInStones("b", "aAAbbbb"));
